                        <p>I'm an incoming junior at UCLA studying Computer Science. I enjoy exploring new tech and learning new concepts by working on projects. Through these projects, I hope to have a positive impact on the world while also having fun. When not programming, I love exploring the outdoors and traveling to new places.</p>
                        <p>My goal is to always keep improving on my skills and exploring new areas of Computer Science. Such new fields that I hope to study in the future include blockchain, machine learning, and data security.</p>
                        <p>I began programming in middle school by developing simple websites with HTML/CSS. Then throughout high school, I started learning Java in preparation for the AP Computer Science A exam in 12th grade. I practiced Java by developing Discord Bots and other applications such as a Maze Generator and Password Manager. Recently I started getting more into web development by further building my skills in vanilla javascript and HTML/CSS. I also started studying React/Node.js/MongoDB to build my full-stack development skills.</p>
